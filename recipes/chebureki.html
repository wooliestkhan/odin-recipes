    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Cheburek! Best food from Russia! Fried pastry, so crunchy, inside meat is juicy with onion and spices. If you not try, you not live, my friend.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 cups flour</li>
        <li>1 shot of vodka</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <em>For dough:</em>
    <ol>
        <li>Add flour to large bowl</li>
        <li>Add egg, water, and sunflower seed oil</li>
        <li>Add salt and sugar</li>
        <li>Add shot of vodka (very important - do not skip this step!)</li>
        <li>Mix components well</li>
        <li>Grab the dough and roughly knead, until consistency of "melted alien brain" is reached. (Add more water/oil if too dry.)</li>
    </ol>
    <em>For filling:</em>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop onions as finely as you can (do not use food processor!)</li>
        <li>Chop garlic</li>
        <li>Chop dill and parsley as finely as you can</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions, garlic, dill and parsley to a mixing bowl</li>
        <li>Add minced meat</li>
        <li>Add ground black pepper</li>
        <li>With your slav hands, mix filling</li>
    </ol>
    <em>Assembly:</em>
    <ol>
        <li>Roll the dough into a "sausage" and cut into 6 equal sections</li>
        <li>Flatten one of the sections into a roughly 6 inch circle</li>
        <li>Add a ball of your filling to the center of the flattened dough (feel free to spread the filling around a little bit)</li>
        <li>Fold one side of the flattened dough to the other side, so it covers the filling.</li>
        <li>Make sure the edges are sufficiently thick to not allow filling to escape while frying.</li>
        <li>Use a fork to seal the edges of the cheburek</li>
        <li>Cut off any extra dough around the edges with a knife</li>
        <li>Repeat process for each section of dough.</li>
    </ol>
    <em>Frying:</em>
<ol>
    <li>Add sunflower seed oil to pan (enough to cover raw cheburek until it's about 75% covered)</li>
    <li>Set it to boil</li>
    <li>Once sufficiently hot, carefully place a few chebureki into the pan (reccomend using wooden spatula)</li>
    <li>Cook for a few minutes, until bottom of chebureki is golden brown</li>
    <li>Flip chebureki and cook other side until they're golden brown as well</li>
    <li>Place unto paper towel to dry</li>
    <li>(Optional: poke a few holes through the cheburek with a toothpick to allow oil to drain.)</li>
    <li>Serve with dark bread, horseradish, or mayonaise and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
